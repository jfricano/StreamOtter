# KafkaSocks API

## I. WebSocketManager API

For the WebSocket management aspect of your library, you will need an API that abstracts the complexity of WebSocket operations while providing a flexible interface for real-time data streaming. Here's a proposal for a simple yet powerful API tailored for WebSocket management within your library:

#### 1. Initialization and Configuration

- **`createConnection(url: string, options?: ConnectionOptions): WebSocketConnection`**

  Initializes a new WebSocket connection to the specified URL. `options` can include custom configurations such as reconnection strategies, serialization/deserialization functions, and headers for authentication.

  - `url`: The WebSocket server URL to connect to.
  - `options`: Optional. Configuration options for the connection.

#### 2. Sending and Receiving Messages

- **`sendMessage(connection: WebSocketConnection, message: any): void`**

  Sends a message through the specified WebSocket connection. The `message` can be of any type; the library will handle serialization based on the provided or default serializer.

  - `connection`: The WebSocketConnection instance to send the message through.
  - `message`: The message to be sent. It can be an object, string, etc.

- **`onMessage(connection: WebSocketConnection, listener: (message: any) => void): void`**

  Registers a listener to handle messages received through the specified WebSocket connection. The library will automatically deserialize incoming messages.

  - `connection`: The WebSocketConnection instance to listen on.
  - `listener`: A callback function that gets executed whenever a message is received.

#### 3. Connection Management

- **`closeConnection(connection: WebSocketConnection, code?: number, reason?: string): void`**

  Closes the specified WebSocket connection optionally with a status code and a reason.

  - `connection`: The WebSocketConnection instance to close.
  - `code`: Optional. The status code explaining why the connection is being closed.
  - `reason`: Optional. A human-readable string explaining why the connection is closed.

- **`onConnectionClosed(connection: WebSocketConnection, listener: (code: number, reason: string) => void): void`**

  Registers a listener to handle the WebSocket connection close event.

  - `connection`: The WebSocketConnection instance to monitor for closure.
  - `listener`: A callback function that gets executed whenever the connection is closed.

#### 4. Connection Resilience

- **`setReconnectionStrategy(connection: WebSocketConnection, strategy: ReconnectionStrategy): void`**

  Sets a reconnection strategy for the specified WebSocket connection. This can include settings like the maximum number of retries, delay between retries, etc.

  - `connection`: The WebSocketConnection instance to set the strategy for.
  - `strategy`: Configuration options for the reconnection strategy.

### Types and Interfaces

- **`ConnectionOptions`**: Configuration options for WebSocket connections, including headers, query parameters, and serializers.
- **`WebSocketConnection`**: Represents a WebSocket connection instance. This is an abstract representation that encapsulates the underlying WebSocket object.
- **`ReconnectionStrategy`**: Defines the strategy for automatic reconnections, including properties like `maxRetries`, `retryDelay`, etc.

### Usage Example

Here's a simple usage example:

```typescript
import { WebSocketManager } from 'your-library';

const wsManager = new WebSocketManager();

const connection = wsManager.createConnection('wss://example.com', {
  // Optional configurations
});

wsManager.onMessage(connection, (message) => {
  console.log('Received message:', message);
});

wsManager.sendMessage(connection, {
  type: 'greeting',
  payload: 'Hello, WebSocket!',
});

// Later...
wsManager.closeConnection(connection);
```

This API design offers a balance between simplicity and flexibility, allowing developers to easily manage WebSocket connections, send and receive messages with custom serialization, and implement robust reconnection strategies, all while keeping the door open for advanced configurations and custom use cases.

  Deserializes received data using the global strategy unless a custom strategy is provided.

  - `data`: The received data to be deserialized.
  - `customStrategy`: Optional. A custom deserialization strategy for this specific piece of data.

### Interfaces and Types

- **`SerializationStrategy`**: An interface that defines a method for serializing data before it is sent over a WebSocket connection.

  Example:

  ```typescript
  interface SerializationStrategy {
    serialize(data: any): string | ArrayBuffer | Blob;
  }
  ```

- **`DeserializationStrategy`**: An interface that defines a method for deserializing data received from a WebSocket connection.

  Example:

  ```typescript
  interface DeserializationStrategy {
    deserialize(data: string | ArrayBuffer | Blob): any;
  }
  ```

### Usage Example

```typescript
import {
  DataSerializationManager,
  SerializationStrategy,
  DeserializationStrategy,
} from 'your-library';

// Define custom serialization strategy
const customSerializationStrategy: SerializationStrategy = {
  serialize(data: any): string {
    return JSON.stringify(data);
  },
};

// Define custom deserialization strategy
const customDeserializationStrategy: DeserializationStrategy = {
  deserialize(data: string): any {
    return JSON.parse(data);
  },
};

// Set global serialization and deserialization strategies
DataSerializationManager.setSerializationStrategy(customSerializationStrategy);
DataSerializationManager.setDeserializationStrategy(
  customDeserializationStrategy
);

// Use custom strategy for specific messages
const message = { type: 'update', content: 'This is a test' };
const serialized = DataSerializationManager.serializeMessage(
  message,
  customSerializationStrategy
);
const deserialized = DataSerializationManager.deserializeMessage(
  serialized,
  customDeserializationStrategy
);
```

## III. ConnectionResilienceManager API

For the Connection Resilience aspect of your library, focusing on implementing automatic reconnection strategies for WebSockets is essential. This feature ensures that temporary network issues or brief disconnections don't interrupt the service, providing a seamless experience for the end-users. Here's how you might design an API to manage connection resilience:

#### 1. Configuration

- **`configureReconnection(options: ReconnectionOptions): void`**

  Sets the global reconnection options that apply to any WebSocket connection managed by the library. These options include parameters like maximum retry attempts, delay between retries, and conditions that trigger a reconnection attempt.

  - `options`: Configuration options for reconnection, such as maximum number of retries, delay strategy, etc.

#### 2. Managing Reconnection

To offer fine-grained control, apart from global settings, each WebSocket connection should allow custom reconnection strategies:

- **`enableReconnection(connection: WebSocketConnection, options?: ReconnectionOptions): void`**

  Enables reconnection for a specific WebSocket connection with optional custom reconnection options. If no options are provided, the global reconnection configuration is used.

  - `connection`: The WebSocketConnection instance for which to enable reconnection.
  - `options`: Optional. Custom reconnection options for this specific connection.

- **`disableReconnection(connection: WebSocketConnection): void`**

  Disables the reconnection mechanism for a specific WebSocket connection. Useful for when you want to manually handle connection lifecycle events or disable reconnection under certain conditions.

  - `connection`: The WebSocketConnection instance for which to disable reconnection.

#### 3. Reconnection Events

To handle reconnection events and provide feedback to the application or user interface, the following event listeners can be implemented:

- **`onReconnecting(connection: WebSocketConnection, listener: (attempt: number) => void): void`**

  Registers a listener that gets called before a reconnection attempt is made, with the attempt number as an argument.

  - `connection`: The WebSocketConnection instance to listen to.
  - `listener`: A callback function that gets executed before a reconnection attempt.

- **`onReconnected(connection: WebSocketConnection, listener: () => void): void`**

  Registers a listener that gets called when the connection is successfully reestablished after one or more reconnection attempts.

  - `connection`: The WebSocketConnection instance to listen to.
  - `listener`: A callback function that gets executed upon successful reconnection.

### Types and Interfaces

- **`ReconnectionOptions`**: Defines options for configuring reconnection behavior. It could include:

  ```typescript
  interface ReconnectionOptions {
    maxRetries: number; // Maximum number of reconnection attempts
    retryDelay: number; // Delay between retries, in milliseconds
    exponentialBackoff: boolean; // Whether to use exponential backoff for delay calculation
  }
  ```

- **`WebSocketConnection`**: Represents an individual WebSocket connection. This abstracts the actual WebSocket connection and includes metadata for managing reconnection.

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { ConnectionResilienceManager, WebSocketManager } from 'your-library';

// Configure global reconnection options
ConnectionResilienceManager.configureReconnection({
  maxRetries: 5,
  retryDelay: 1000,
  exponentialBackoff: true,
});

const wsManager = new WebSocketManager();
const connection = wsManager.createConnection('wss://example.com');

// Enable reconnection with custom options for a specific connection
ConnectionResilienceManager.enableReconnection(connection, {
  maxRetries: 3,
  retryDelay: 500,
});

// Listen for reconnection events
ConnectionResilienceManager.onReconnecting(connection, (attempt) => {
  console.log(`Attempting to reconnect, attempt number: ${attempt}`);
});

ConnectionResilienceManager.onReconnected(connection, () => {
  console.log(`Successfully reconnected.`);
});
```

This Connection Resilience API design provides a robust foundation for managing WebSocket reconnections, offering both global and per-connection configuration options, as well as event listeners for integrating reconnection logic seamlessly into the application's flow.
