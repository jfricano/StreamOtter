## 9. Usage Example

Below is a comprehensive usage example demonstrating how to utilize the `WebSocketManager` API to establish a connection, handle messages and errors, implement reconnection strategies, and integrate middleware for message processing.

```typescript
import {
  WebSocketManager,
  SerializationStrategy,
  DeserializationStrategy,
  MiddlewareFunction,
  ConnectionState,
} from "your-library";

// Initialize WebSocketManager
const wsManager = new WebSocketManager();

// Define a custom serialization strategy (e.g., JSON)
const jsonSerializationStrategy: SerializationStrategy = {
  serialize(data: any): string {
    return JSON.stringify(data);
  },
};

// Define a custom deserialization strategy
const jsonDeserializationStrategy: DeserializationStrategy = {
  deserialize(data: string): any {
    return JSON.parse(data);
  },
};

// Define middleware for logging outgoing messages
const outgoingLoggingMiddleware: MiddlewareFunction = (message, next) => {
  console.log("Outgoing message:", message);
  next(message);
};

// Define middleware for logging incoming messages
const incomingLoggingMiddleware: MiddlewareFunction = (message, next) => {
  console.log("Incoming message:", message);
  next(message);
};

// Create a WebSocket connection with custom options
const connection = wsManager.createConnection("wss://example.com/socket", {
  headers: { Authorization: "Bearer your-token" },
  serializer: jsonSerializationStrategy,
  deserializer: jsonDeserializationStrategy,
  middleware: [outgoingLoggingMiddleware, incomingLoggingMiddleware],
  reconnectionStrategy: {
    type: "exponential",
    maxRetries: 5,
    retryDelay: 1000, // Start with 1 second
    factor: 2, // Double the delay each retry
  },
});

// Register a message listener
wsManager.onMessage(connection, (message) => {
  console.log("Received message from server:", message);
});

// Register an error listener
wsManager.onError(connection, (error) => {
  console.error("WebSocket encountered an error:", error);
});

// Register a connection closed listener
wsManager.onConnectionClosed(connection, (code, reason) => {
  console.log(`WebSocket connection closed. Code: ${code}, Reason: ${reason}`);
});

// Send a message to the server
wsManager.sendMessage(connection, {
  type: "greeting",
  payload: "Hello, WebSocket Server!",
});

// Query the connection state
const state = wsManager.getConnectionState(connection);
console.log("Current connection state:", ConnectionState[state]);

// Later in the application lifecycle, close the connection gracefully
wsManager.closeConnection(connection, 1000, "Normal closure");
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **Initialization:**

   - An instance of `WebSocketManager` is created to manage WebSocket connections.

2. **Serialization Strategies:**

   - Custom serialization and deserialization strategies are defined using JSON. These strategies ensure that messages are properly formatted when sent and correctly interpreted when received.

3. **Middleware:**

   - Two middleware functions are defined:
     - **Outgoing Middleware:** Logs messages being sent to the server.
     - **Incoming Middleware:** Logs messages received from the server.
   - These middleware functions are added to the connection's middleware stack to intercept and process messages.

4. **Connection Creation:**

   - A WebSocket connection is established to `"wss://example.com/socket"` with custom headers for authentication, serialization strategies, middleware, and a reconnection strategy employing exponential backoff.

5. **Event Listeners:**

   - **Message Listener:** Handles incoming messages by logging them to the console.
   - **Error Listener:** Captures and logs any errors that occur within the WebSocket connection.
   - **Connection Closed Listener:** Logs the reason and code when the connection is closed.

6. **Sending Messages:**

   - A greeting message is sent to the server using the `sendMessage` method. The message is automatically serialized using the defined serialization strategy.

7. **Connection State:**

   - The current state of the connection is queried and logged, providing insight into whether the connection is open, closing, closed, etc.

8. **Closing the Connection:**
   - The WebSocket connection is gracefully closed with a status code `1000`, indicating a normal closure, along with a reason.

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Modularity:** Each aspect of the WebSocket connection (serialization, middleware, reconnection) is modular, allowing for easy customization and extension.
- **Robustness:** Built-in reconnection strategies and comprehensive event handling ensure that connections remain stable and that errors are appropriately managed.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Intuitive method names and clear parameter structures make the API easy to use and integrate into various applications.
- **Flexibility:** Middleware support allows developers to implement custom logic for message processing, enhancing the capability to handle complex use cases.
