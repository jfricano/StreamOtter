## 1. Configuration

### Setting Global Reconnection Options

**`configureReconnection(options: ReconnectionOptions): void`**

Configures the global reconnection settings that apply to all WebSocket connections managed by StreamOtter. These settings include parameters such as the maximum number of reconnection attempts, the delay between retries, and the type of backoff strategy to use.

- **Parameters:**
  - `options` (_ReconnectionOptions_): An object defining the global reconnection behavior.

```typescript
interface ReconnectionOptions {
  maxRetries: number; // Maximum number of reconnection attempts
  retryDelay: number; // Initial delay between retries in milliseconds
  backoffStrategy: "exponential" | "linear" | "fixed"; // Type of backoff strategy
  factor?: number; // Multiplicative factor for exponential backoff
  jitter?: boolean; // Whether to apply jitter to delay times
  circuitBreakerThreshold?: number; // Number of consecutive failures to trigger circuit breaker
  circuitBreakerCooldown?: number; // Cooldown period before attempting reconnections after circuit breaker is triggered
}
```

---

## 2. Managing Reconnection

### Enabling Reconnection for Specific Connections

**`enableReconnection(connection: WebSocketConnection, options?: ReconnectionOptions): void`**

Enables the reconnection mechanism for a specific WebSocket connection. Developers can optionally provide custom reconnection options that override the global settings for this particular connection.

- **Parameters:**
  - `connection` (_WebSocketConnection_): The WebSocket connection instance to enable reconnection for.
  - `options` (_ReconnectionOptions_, optional): Custom reconnection settings for this connection.

### Disabling Reconnection for Specific Connections

**`disableReconnection(connection: WebSocketConnection): void`**

Disables the reconnection mechanism for a specific WebSocket connection. This is useful when developers want to handle connection lifecycle events manually or prevent automatic reconnections under certain conditions.

- **Parameters:**
  - `connection` (_WebSocketConnection_): The WebSocket connection instance to disable reconnection for.

---

## 3. Reconnection Strategies

### Backoff Strategies

To prevent overwhelming the server and network during reconnection attempts, `ConnectionResilienceManager` supports various backoff strategies:

- **Exponential Backoff:** Increases the delay between each reconnection attempt exponentially.
- **Linear Backoff:** Increases the delay between each attempt linearly.
- **Fixed Backoff:** Maintains a constant delay between reconnection attempts.
- **Jitter:** Adds randomness to the delay times to prevent synchronized reconnection attempts in distributed systems.

**Example: Exponential Backoff Strategy**

```typescript
const exponentialBackoffStrategy: ReconnectionOptions = {
  maxRetries: 5,
  retryDelay: 1000, // 1 second
  backoffStrategy: "exponential",
  factor: 2, // Doubles the delay each retry
  jitter: true,
};
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

To avoid futile reconnection attempts when the server is down or experiencing issues, `ConnectionResilienceManager` implements a circuit breaker pattern. After a specified number of consecutive failures, the circuit breaker halts further reconnection attempts for a defined cooldown period.

**Circuit Breaker Configuration:**

```typescript
const circuitBreakerOptions: ReconnectionOptions = {
  maxRetries: 5,
  retryDelay: 1000,
  backoffStrategy: "exponential",
  circuitBreakerThreshold: 3, // Triggers after 3 consecutive failures
  circuitBreakerCooldown: 30000, // 30 seconds cooldown
};
```

## 4. Connection Health Checks

Regularly monitoring the health of WebSocket connections ensures that any anomalies or degradations in connection quality are promptly detected and addressed. `ConnectionResilienceManager` provides mechanisms to perform periodic health checks and trigger reconnections if necessary.

**Health Check Features:**

- **Ping/Pong Mechanism:** Sends periodic ping messages to verify that the connection is still alive.
- **Timeout Detection:** Detects if pong responses are not received within a specified timeframe.
- **Automatic Reconnection:** Initiates reconnection attempts upon detecting unhealthy connections.

**Configuration Example:**

```typescript
interface HealthCheckOptions {
  interval: number; // Interval between health checks in milliseconds
  timeout: number; // Time to wait for a pong response before considering the connection unhealthy
}

function configureHealthChecks(
  connection: WebSocketConnection,
  options: HealthCheckOptions
): void {
  // Implementation to set up health checks
}
```

---

## 5. Reconnection Events

To provide developers with real-time feedback and control over the reconnection process, `ConnectionResilienceManager` emits various events related to reconnection attempts and outcomes.

### `onReconnecting`

**`onReconnecting(connection: WebSocketConnection, listener: (attempt: number, delay: number) => void): void`**

Registers a listener that is invoked before a reconnection attempt is made. It provides the attempt number and the delay before the next attempt.

- **Parameters:**
  - `connection` (_WebSocketConnection_): The WebSocket connection instance being monitored.
  - `listener` (_function_): A callback function that receives the attempt number and delay.

### `onReconnected`

**`onReconnected(connection: WebSocketConnection, listener: () => void): void`**

Registers a listener that is invoked when a WebSocket connection is successfully reestablished after one or more reconnection attempts.

- **Parameters:**
  - `connection` (_WebSocketConnection_): The WebSocket connection instance being monitored.
  - `listener` (_function_): A callback function that is executed upon successful reconnection.

### `onCircuitBreakerOpen`

**`onCircuitBreakerOpen(connection: WebSocketConnection, listener: () => void): void`**

Registers a listener that is invoked when the circuit breaker is triggered, halting further reconnection attempts until the cooldown period elapses.

- **Parameters:**
  - `connection` (_WebSocketConnection_): The WebSocket connection instance being monitored.
  - `listener` (_function_): A callback function that is executed when the circuit breaker opens.

### `onCircuitBreakerClosed`

**`onCircuitBreakerClosed(connection: WebSocketConnection, listener: () => void): void`**

Registers a listener that is invoked when the circuit breaker resets after the cooldown period, allowing reconnection attempts to resume.

- **Parameters:**
  - `connection` (_WebSocketConnection_): The WebSocket connection instance being monitored.
  - `listener` (_function_): A callback function that is executed when the circuit breaker closes.

## 6. Types and Interfaces

### `ReconnectionOptions`

Defines the configuration options for reconnection behavior, including backoff strategies, circuit breaker settings, and jitter.

```typescript
interface ReconnectionOptions {
  maxRetries: number; // Maximum number of reconnection attempts
  retryDelay: number; // Initial delay between retries in milliseconds
  backoffStrategy: "exponential" | "linear" | "fixed"; // Type of backoff strategy
  factor?: number; // Multiplicative factor for exponential backoff
  jitter?: boolean; // Whether to apply jitter to delay times
  circuitBreakerThreshold?: number; // Number of consecutive failures to trigger circuit breaker
  circuitBreakerCooldown?: number; // Cooldown period before attempting reconnections after circuit breaker is triggered
}
```

### `WebSocketConnection`

Represents an individual WebSocket connection managed by StreamOtter. This interface abstracts the underlying WebSocket object and includes metadata necessary for managing reconnection and health checks.

```typescript
interface WebSocketConnection {
  id: string; // Unique identifier for the connection
  socket: WebSocket; // Underlying WebSocket object
  options: ConnectionOptions; // Configuration options for the connection
  state: ConnectionState; // Current state of the connection
  reconnectionOptions?: ReconnectionOptions; // Custom reconnection options if set
  // Additional metadata as needed
}
```

### `ConnectionState`

Enum representing the various states of a WebSocket connection.

```typescript
enum ConnectionState {
  CONNECTING,
  OPEN,
  CLOSING,
  CLOSED,
}
```

### `HealthCheckOptions`

Defines the configuration options for performing connection health checks.

```typescript
interface HealthCheckOptions {
  interval: number; // Interval between health checks in milliseconds
  timeout: number; // Time to wait for a pong response before considering the connection unhealthy
}
```

## 7. Usage Example

Below is a comprehensive usage example demonstrating how to utilize the `ConnectionResilienceManager API` to configure global and per-connection reconnection strategies, handle reconnection events, implement circuit breaker patterns, and set up connection health checks.

```typescript
import {
  ConnectionResilienceManager,
  WebSocketManager,
  ReconnectionOptions,
  HealthCheckOptions,
} from "your-library";

// Initialize WebSocketManager
const wsManager = new WebSocketManager();

// Configure global reconnection options with exponential backoff and circuit breaker
const globalReconnectionOptions: ReconnectionOptions = {
  maxRetries: 5,
  retryDelay: 1000, // 1 second
  backoffStrategy: "exponential",
  factor: 2, // Doubles the delay each retry
  jitter: true, // Adds randomness to delay times
  circuitBreakerThreshold: 3, // Trigger circuit breaker after 3 consecutive failures
  circuitBreakerCooldown: 30000, // 30 seconds cooldown period
};

ConnectionResilienceManager.configureReconnection(globalReconnectionOptions);

// Create a WebSocket connection
const connection = wsManager.createConnection("wss://example.com/socket", {
  // Connection-specific configurations
});

// Enable reconnection with custom options for this connection
const customReconnectionOptions: ReconnectionOptions = {
  maxRetries: 3,
  retryDelay: 500, // 0.5 seconds
  backoffStrategy: "linear",
  jitter: false,
};

ConnectionResilienceManager.enableReconnection(
  connection,
  customReconnectionOptions
);

// Listen for reconnection events
ConnectionResilienceManager.onReconnecting(connection, (attempt, delay) => {
  console.log(`Reconnecting attempt ${attempt} in ${delay}ms...`);
});

ConnectionResilienceManager.onReconnected(connection, () => {
  console.log("Successfully reconnected to the WebSocket server.");
});

ConnectionResilienceManager.onCircuitBreakerOpen(connection, () => {
  console.warn("Circuit breaker activated. Reconnection attempts halted.");
});

ConnectionResilienceManager.onCircuitBreakerClosed(connection, () => {
  console.log("Circuit breaker reset. Reconnection attempts can resume.");
});

// Configure connection health checks
const healthCheckOptions: HealthCheckOptions = {
  interval: 5000, // Every 5 seconds
  timeout: 2000, // Wait 2 seconds for a pong response
};

ConnectionResilienceManager.configureHealthChecks(
  connection,
  healthCheckOptions
);

// Example of sending a message
wsManager.sendMessage(connection, {
  type: "heartbeat",
  payload: "Ping",
});

// Later in the application lifecycle, disable reconnection if needed
// ConnectionResilienceManager.disableReconnection(connection);
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **Initialization:**

   - An instance of `WebSocketManager` is created to manage WebSocket connections.

2. **Global Reconnection Configuration:**

   - The global reconnection settings are configured with an exponential backoff strategy, allowing up to 5 reconnection attempts with a 1-second initial delay that doubles with each attempt. Jitter is enabled to add randomness to the delay times, preventing synchronized reconnection attempts in distributed systems.
   - A circuit breaker is set to activate after 3 consecutive reconnection failures, halting further attempts for a 30-second cooldown period.

3. **Creating a WebSocket Connection:**

   - A WebSocket connection is established to `"wss://example.com/socket"` with optional connection-specific configurations.

4. **Per-Connection Reconnection Configuration:**

   - The reconnection mechanism is enabled for the specific connection with custom options: a linear backoff strategy, allowing up to 3 reconnection attempts with a 0.5-second delay between each attempt, and jitter is disabled.

5. **Event Listeners:**

   - **`onReconnecting`:** Logs each reconnection attempt with its attempt number and delay before the next attempt.
   - **`onReconnected`:** Logs a confirmation message upon successful reconnection.
   - **`onCircuitBreakerOpen`:** Logs a warning when the circuit breaker is activated, indicating that reconnection attempts are halted.
   - **`onCircuitBreakerClosed`:** Logs a message when the circuit breaker resets, allowing reconnection attempts to resume.

6. **Connection Health Checks:**

   - Health checks are configured to send a ping message every 5 seconds and wait up to 2 seconds for a pong response. If a pong is not received within the timeout, the connection is considered unhealthy, and reconnection attempts are triggered.

7. **Sending Messages:**

   - A heartbeat message is sent through the WebSocket connection to maintain activity and verify the connection's health.

8. **Disabling Reconnection:**
   - As needed, developers can disable the reconnection mechanism for a specific connection, allowing for manual management of the connection lifecycle.

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Flexibility:** Developers can define both global and per-connection reconnection strategies, tailoring the behavior to different parts of the application.
- **Robustness:** Implementing various backoff strategies and circuit breaker patterns ensures that the application can handle diverse network conditions gracefully without overwhelming the server or network.
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Connection health checks enable early detection of connection issues, allowing for prompt reconnection attempts and maintaining data integrity.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Reconnection events provide developers with real-time insights into the connection status, facilitating better debugging and user experience management.
- **Scalability:** The ability to manage multiple connections with individual resilience settings ensures that the API can scale with the application's growth and complexity.
