### 1. Versioning Strategy

StreamOtter adopts **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** to manage API versions systematically. This approach ensures clarity in version increments and maintains backward compatibility, providing developers with predictable and reliable updates.

#### **Semantic Versioning Format**

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- **MAJOR**: Incremented for incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR**: Incremented for backward-compatible feature additions.
- **PATCH**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.

#### **Versioning Guidelines**

- **Initial Development**: Versions `0.x.y` are considered initial development phases. APIs may change without prior notice.
- **Stable Release**: Once the API is deemed stable, the major version is set to `1.0.0`.
- **Backward Compatibility**:
  - **PATCH** updates do not introduce breaking changes.
  - **MINOR** updates add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
  - **MAJOR** updates may introduce breaking changes that require developers to modify their existing codebases.

#### **Example Version Increments**

- `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`: Added new features without breaking existing functionalities.
- `1.1.0` → `1.1.1`: Fixed bugs without altering the API.
- `1.1.1` → `2.0.0`: Introduced breaking changes that may require codebase adjustments.

### 2. Modular Architecture

StreamOtter's modular architecture breaks down the API into distinct, independent modules. This design promotes flexibility, allowing developers to integrate only the components relevant to their projects, thereby optimizing performance and reducing unnecessary dependencies.

#### **Core Modules**

1. **WebSocketManager**: Manages WebSocket connections and real-time data streaming.
2. **DataSerializationManager**: Handles data serialization and deserialization processes.
3. **ConnectionResilienceManager**: Ensures connection stability through reconnection strategies.
4. **KafkaIntegrationManager**: Facilitates integration with Kafka for message brokering.
5. **SecurityManager**: Provides security features for WebSocket and Kafka communications.
6. **ErrorHandlingAndLoggingManager**: Manages error handling and logging mechanisms.
7. **WebSocketClient**: Offers client-side utilities for managing WebSocket connections.
8. **Additional Features**: Includes supplementary functionalities like rate limiting, telemetry, plugin systems, etc.

#### **Benefits of Modularization**

- **Scalability**: Easily add or remove modules based on project needs.
- **Maintainability**: Isolate functionalities, making debugging and updates more straightforward.
- **Reusability**: Utilize modules across different projects without redundancy.
- **Customization**: Tailor the API to fit specific use cases by selecting relevant modules.

#### **Module Dependencies**

Each module is designed to function independently; however, certain modules may depend on others for extended functionalities. Dependencies are clearly documented to guide developers in integrating modules effectively.

### 4. Upgrade Guidelines

Upgrading StreamOtter to newer versions should be approached systematically to prevent disruptions. The following guidelines assist developers in managing upgrades effectively:

#### **Review Release Notes**

Before upgrading, review the release notes for the target version to understand new features, bug fixes, and potential breaking changes.

#### **Check Version Compatibility**

Ensure that the new version is compatible with your project's dependencies and environment. Pay special attention to MAJOR version changes that may introduce breaking changes.

#### **Update Modules Sequentially**

If multiple modules are involved, update them sequentially, verifying functionality after each update to isolate and address issues promptly.

#### **Run Tests**

Execute existing test suites to verify that the upgrade does not introduce regressions or unexpected behaviors.

#### **Backup Configuration**

Prior to upgrading, back up existing configurations and data to facilitate rollback if necessary.

#### **Example Upgrade Process**

1. **Backup Current Setup:**

   ```bash
   cp ./config.json ./config_backup.json
   ```

2. **Update StreamOtter:**

   ```bash
   npm update streamotter
   ```

3. **Run Tests:**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Verify Functionality:**

### 7. Usage Example

The following example demonstrates how to implement versioning and modularization features within a StreamOtter-powered application. It covers initializing versioning settings, registering modules, and managing plugins.

```typescript
import {
  VersioningManager,
  ModuleManager,
  PluginManager,
  SemanticVersion,
} from "streamotter";

// 1. Configure Versioning Strategy
const currentVersion: SemanticVersion = { major: 1, minor: 3, patch: 0 };
VersioningManager.configureVersioning({
  strategy: "semver",
  currentVersion,
});

// 2. Define and Register a Module
const analyticsModule: Module = {
  name: "AnalyticsModule",
  version: { major: 1, minor: 0, patch: 0 },
  dependencies: ["WebSocketManager"],
  initialize: () => {
    console.log("AnalyticsModule initialized.");
    // Initialization logic here
  },
  destroy: () => {
    console.log("AnalyticsModule destroyed.");
    // Cleanup logic here
  },
};

ModuleManager.registerModule(analyticsModule);

// 3. Register a Plugin
const monitoringPlugin: Plugin = {
  name: "MonitoringPlugin",
  version: { major: 1, minor: 0, patch: 0 },
  init: (api) => {
    api.registerModule({
      name: "MonitoringModule",
      version: { major: 1, minor: 0, patch: 0 },
      initialize: () => {
        console.log("MonitoringModule initialized via plugin.");
        // Initialization logic here
      },
      destroy: () => {
        console.log("MonitoringModule destroyed via plugin.");
        // Cleanup logic here
      },
    });
  },
  destroy: () => {
    console.log("MonitoringPlugin destroyed.");
    // Cleanup logic here
  },
};

PluginManager.registerPlugin(monitoringPlugin);

// 4. Upgrade StreamOtter Version
VersioningManager.upgradeVersion({
  major: 1,
  minor: 4,
  patch: 0,
});

// 5. Access Current Version
const current = VersioningManager.getCurrentVersion();
console.log(
  `Current StreamOtter Version: ${current.major}.${current.minor}.${current.patch}`
);

// 6. Unregister a Plugin
PluginManager.unregisterPlugin("MonitoringPlugin");

// 7. Unregister a Module
ModuleManager.unregisterModule("AnalyticsModule");
```

### Explanation of the Usage Example

1. **Configuring Versioning**:
   - The `VersioningManager` is configured to use Semantic Versioning with the current version set to `1.3.0`.
2. **Defining and Registering a Module**:
   - An `AnalyticsModule` is defined with its own version and dependencies.
   - The module is registered using the `ModuleManager`, initializing its functionality.
3. **Registering a Plugin**:
   - A `MonitoringPlugin` is created, which upon initialization registers a `MonitoringModule`.
   - This demonstrates how plugins can dynamically extend StreamOtter's capabilities by introducing new modules.
4. **Upgrading StreamOtter Version**:
   - The `VersioningManager` handles upgrading StreamOtter's version to `1.4.0`, ensuring that all modules and plugins adhere to the new versioning rules.
5. **Accessing Current Version**:
   - The current version of StreamOtter is retrieved and logged, providing visibility into the library's state.
6. **Unregistering a Plugin and Module**:
   - The `MonitoringPlugin` and `AnalyticsModule` are unregistered, demonstrating the flexibility of the modular architecture in managing components lifecycle.
