### 8. Usage Example

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to utilize the `WebSocketClient API` to establish a connection, send and receive messages, handle reconnections, and integrate middleware.

```typescript
import { WebSocketClient, LogLevel } from "your-library";

// Initialize the WebSocket client
const wsClient = new WebSocketClient();

// Define connection options with custom headers and serialization strategies
const connectionOptions: ClientConnectionOptions = {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer your-auth-token",
  },
  serializers: {
    serialize: (data: any) => JSON.stringify(data),
    deserialize: (data: string) => JSON.parse(data),
  },
  reconnection: {
    maxRetries: 5,
    retryDelay: 2000,
    exponentialBackoff: true,
  },
  heartbeatInterval: 30000, // Send heartbeat every 30 seconds
};

// Create a new WebSocket connection
const connection = wsClient.createConnection(
  "wss://example.com/socket",
  connectionOptions
);

// Register a message listener
wsClient.onMessage(connection, (message) => {
  console.log("Received message:", message);
});

// Send a message through the connection
wsClient.sendMessage(connection, {
  type: "greeting",
  payload: "Hello from the client!",
});

// Add middleware to log outgoing messages
wsClient.useMiddleware(connection, (message, next) => {
  console.log("Sending message:", message);
  next(); // Proceed with sending the message
});

// Handle connection close events
wsClient.onConnectionClosed(connection, (code, reason) => {
  console.log(`Connection closed. Code: ${code}, Reason: ${reason}`);
});

// Handle reconnection attempts
wsClient.onReconnecting(connection, (attempt) => {
  console.log(`Reconnection attempt #${attempt}`);
});

// Handle successful reconnections
wsClient.onReconnected(connection, () => {
  console.log("Successfully reconnected to the WebSocket server.");
});

// Set up heartbeat monitoring
wsClient.onHeartbeat(connection, () => {
  console.log("Heartbeat sent to keep the connection alive.");
});

// Later in the application lifecycle, close the connection gracefully
// wsClient.closeConnection(connection, 1000, "User initiated closure");
```

### Explanation of the Usage Example

1. **Initialization**:

   - A new instance of `WebSocketClient` is created.
   - Connection options are defined, including custom headers for authentication, serialization strategies (JSON in this case), reconnection settings, and a heartbeat interval.

2. **Creating a Connection**:

   - A new WebSocket connection is established to `wss://example.com/socket` using the defined options.

3. **Message Handling**:

   - A listener is registered to handle incoming messages, logging them to the console.
   - A message is sent through the connection with a type and payload.

4. **Middleware Integration**:

   - A middleware function is added to log outgoing messages before they are sent.

5. **Connection Lifecycle Management**:

   - Listeners are registered to handle connection closure events, reconnection attempts, and successful reconnections, providing feedback through console logs.

6. **Heartbeat Mechanism**:

   - A listener is set up to log each heartbeat message sent, ensuring the connection remains active.

7. **Graceful Closure**:
   - The connection can be closed gracefully by invoking `closeConnection` with an appropriate status code and reason.

### 9. Advanced Features

The `WebSocketClient API` offers advanced features to enhance the flexibility and robustness of client-side WebSocket management.

#### **a. Structured Logging in Middleware**

Middleware can leverage structured logging to send detailed and organized log entries to logging services or for local debugging.

```typescript
wsClient.useMiddleware(connection, (message, next) => {
  const logEntry = {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    level: LogLevel.DEBUG,
    message: "Outgoing message",
    context: {
      connectionId: connection.id,
      data: message,
    },
  };
  ErrorHandlingAndLoggingManager.log(JSON.stringify(logEntry), LogLevel.DEBUG);
  next(message);
});
```

#### **b. Custom Reconnection Strategies**

Developers can implement custom reconnection strategies by modifying the `ReconnectionOptions` or extending the existing ones.

```typescript
const customReconnectionOptions: ReconnectionOptions = {
  maxRetries: 10,
  retryDelay: 1000,
  exponentialBackoff: false,
};

// Apply custom reconnection strategy to the connection
wsClient.enableReconnection(connection, customReconnectionOptions);
```

#### **c. Integration with External Monitoring Tools**

Integrate the WebSocket client with external monitoring and alerting tools to gain deeper insights into connection performance and reliability.

```typescript
import { ExternalLoggingOptions } from "your-library";

const externalLoggingOptions: ExternalLoggingOptions = {
  service: "Datadog",
  apiKey: "your-datadog-api-key",
  endpoint: "https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.com",
  format: "json",
};

// Configure external logging service
ErrorHandlingAndLoggingManager.configureExternalLogging(externalLoggingOptions);

// Send a log entry to Datadog
const logEntry: LogEntry = {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  level: LogLevel.INFO,
  message: "WebSocket client initialized",
  context: { connectionId: connection.id },
  module: "WebSocketClient",
};

ErrorHandlingAndLoggingManager.sendToExternalService(logEntry)
  .then(() => console.log("Log entry sent to Datadog"))
  .catch((error) =>
    console.error("Failed to send log entry to Datadog", error)
  );
```

#### **d. Dynamic Configuration Updates**

Allow dynamic updates to connection configurations without restarting the application, enabling real-time adjustments based on runtime conditions.

```typescript
// Update serialization strategy dynamically
const newSerializationStrategy: SerializationStrategy = {
  serialize: (data: any) => {
    // Custom serialization logic
    return Buffer.from(data).toString("base64");
  },
  deserialize: (data: string) => {
    // Custom deserialization logic
    return Buffer.from(data, "base64").toString();
  },
};

wsClient.updateSerializationStrategy(connection, newSerializationStrategy);
```
